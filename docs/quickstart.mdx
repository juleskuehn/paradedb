title: Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with ParadeDB:

1. Create a ParadeDB instance
2. Connect to ParadeDB
3. Execute full text, similarity, and hybrid search with SQL

## Create a ParadeDB Instance

The fastest way to create an instance is through the [ParadeDB Cloud dashboard](https://dashboard.paradedb.com).
Alternatively, you can also pull the ParadeDB docker image and run it locally.

```bash
docker run \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may set `user`, `password`, and `dbname` to whatever values you want â€” these will be your database
connection credentials. By default, this will start a ParadeDB instance at `http://localhost:5432`.

## Connect to ParadeDB

<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Ensure that you have `psql` installed on your machine.
</Note>

To connect to ParadeDB, run

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <user> -d <dbname> -p <port> -W
```

If you are using ParadeDB Cloud, your connection credentials can be found in the cloud console.

## Full Text Search

ParadeDB comes with a helper function that creates a test table to help you get started.
Once connected with `psql`, run the following commands to create this test table:

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_search_test_table();
CREATE TABLE mock_items AS SELECT * FROM paradedb.search_test_table;
SELECT description, rating, category, embedding FROM mock_items LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
 id |       description        | rating |  category   | embedding
----+--------------------------+--------+-------------+-----------
  1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics | [3,4,5]
  2 | Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics | [4,5,6]
  3 | Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear    | [5,6,7]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's index this table for full-text search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mock_items
ON mock_items
USING bm25 ((mock_items.*))
WITH (
  text_fields='{"description": {"tokenizer": {"type": "en_stem"}}, "category": {}}'
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```bash
CREATE INDEX
```
</Accordion>

Under the hood, this command creates a Postgres-native index called `idx_mock_items`, which contains
an inverted index of the `mock_items` table. [Custom index configuration options](/indexing/bm25), such as
tokenizers, can be specified in the `WITH` option.

Let's execute a full-text search:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics';
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
         description         | rating |  category
-----------------------------+--------+-------------
 Plastic Keyboard            |      4 | Electronics
 Ergonomic metal keyboard    |      4 | Electronics
 Innovative wireless earbuds |      5 | Electronics
 Fast charging power bank    |      4 | Electronics
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker   |      3 | Electronics
(5 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's see how ParadeDB handles a search query like "bluetooth speaker", which

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:"bluetooth speaker"~1';
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
        description        | rating |  category
---------------------------+--------+-------------
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker |      3 | Electronics
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

Notice that we must wrap phrases with whitespace in double quotes and our use of the `~1` slop operator,
which tells the search engine to return matches even if they are separated by `1` word.

Finally, let's implement typo tolerance using the `ngrams` tokenizer. To do this, we'll need to drop and
recreate our index:

``` sql
DROP INDEX idx_mock_items;

CREATE INDEX idx_mock_items
ON mock_items
USING bm25 ((mock_items.*))
WITH (
  text_fields='{"description": {tokenizer: {type: "ngram", min_gram: 3, max_gram: 3, prefix_only: true}}, "category": {}}'
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:bluetoohth';
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
        description        | rating |  category
---------------------------+--------+-------------
 Bluetooth-enabled speaker |      3 | Electronics
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

This quickstart covers only a small subset of the queries you can run with [ParadeQL, our mini query language](search/bm25).

## Similarity Search

Let's query our table with a vector and order the results by L2 distance:

```sql
SELECT description, category, rating, embedding
FROM mock_items
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1,2,3]' LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
       description       |  category  | rating | embedding
-------------------------+------------+--------+-----------
 Artistic ceramic vase   | Home Decor |      4 | [1,2,3]
 Modern wall clock       | Home Decor |      4 | [1,2,3]
 Designer wall paintings | Home Decor |      5 | [1,2,3]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Hybrid Search

Finally, let's implement hybrid search, which combines BM25-based full text scores with vector-based
similarity scores. Hybrid search is especially useful in scenarios where you want to match by both
exact keywords and semantic meaning.

Let's execute a hybrid search:

```sql
SELECT
    description,
    category,
    rating,
    paradedb.weighted_mean(
        paradedb.minmax_bm25(ctid, 'idx_mock_items', 'keyboard'),
        1 - paradedb.minmax_norm(
          '[1,2,3]' <-> embedding,
          MIN('[1,2,3]' <-> embedding) OVER (),
          MAX('[1,2,3]' <-> embedding) OVER ()
        ),
        ARRAY[0.8,0.2]
    ) as score_hybrid
FROM mock_items
ORDER BY score_hybrid DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
         description         |  category   | rating |    score_hybrid
-----------------------------+-------------+--------+--------------------
 Plastic Keyboard            | Electronics |      4 | 0.9142857142857144
 Ergonomic metal keyboard    | Electronics |      4 | 0.8337662424360004
 Innovative wireless earbuds | Electronics |      5 | 0.6309006759098599
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

In this query, we first use `paradedb.minmax_bm25` to calculate each row's normalized BM25 score with respect to
the query "keyboard." Next, we use a function called `paradedb.minmax_norm` to normalize the HNSW scores, and invert
the scores such that the lowest HNSW score is ranked the highest. Finally, we combine the two scores as a weighted average, assigning a weight of `0.8` to the first BM25 score and
a weight of `0.2` to the latter score.

## Congratulations!

You've now seen how ParadeDB serves as both a Postgres database and search engine.
